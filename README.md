```

## üé≤ Gameplay Tips

### Scoring Strategy
- **Asteroids**: 10 √ó level points
- **Enemy Ships**: 25 √ó level points (higher reward!)
- **Level Up**: Every 100 points advances you one level

### Survival Tips
- Use power-ups strategically
- Shield protects from one hit - use it wisely
- Enemy ships are worth more points but are more dangerous
- Higher levels = faster enemies and more frequent spawning

### Power-ups
- **Shield** (Blue): Protects from one asteroid or enemy bullet hit
- **Rapid Fire** (Red): Increases shooting speed for limited time

## üîß Technical Details

### Built With
- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language
- **Pygame**: Game development framework
- **NumPy**: Audio synthesis and mathematical operations

### Architecture
- Object-oriented design with separate classes for game entities
- Real-time collision detection system
- Procedural audio generation using digital signal processing
- Event-driven game loop with 60 FPS target

## üèÜ Game Progression

| Level | Asteroid Speed | Spawn Rate | Enemy Features |
|-------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| 1-2   | Normal        | Standard   | Basic movement |
| 3-5   | +30% per level| Faster     | Increased shooting |
| 6-8   | +60% per level| Much faster| Strategic movement |
| 9-10  | Maximum speed | Rapid spawn| Elite enemies |

## üéµ Audio Features

- **Background Music**: 4-second looping procedural melody
- **Sound Effects**: 
  - Shooting sounds (rising tone)
  - Explosion effects (noise burst with fade)
  - Power-up pickup sounds (ascending tone)
  - Level-up celebration sounds

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"No module named pygame"**: Run `pip install pygame`
2. **"No module named numpy"**: Run `pip install numpy`
3. **Audio not working**: Check system audio settings
4. **Game running slowly**: Close other applications to free up resources

### Performance Tips
- Game runs best at 60 FPS
- Audio requires NumPy for procedural generation
- Close unnecessary applications for optimal performance
